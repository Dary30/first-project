                    I am a 22 years old student at "Aurel Vlaicu" University in Arad,
                    studying for a Computer Science degree and this is my first big
                    project where I try my best to make it look as professional as I could.
                </div>
                <div class="about-text">
                    My goal is by the time I finish the University to have at least a few
                    big projects in multiple languages and to be enployed somewhere where
                    I could learn a lot more things.
                </div>
                <div class="about-text">
                    I will definitely come back to this project to see what else I can do
                    to improve it.
