                    Charles Marc Hervé Perceval Leclerc was born on 16 October 1997 is
                    a Monégasque racing driver, currently racing in Formula One for
                    Scuderia Ferrari, contracted until the end of the 2024 season.
                    He won the GP3 Series championship in 2016 and the FIA Formula 2

                <div class="section-one-text">
                    Leclerc made his Formula One debut in 2018 for Sauber, a team
                    affiliated with Ferrari, for which he was part of the Ferrari
                    Driver Academy. With Sauber having finished last the year before,
                    Leclerc led the charge to improve its finishing position in the
                    constructors' championship to eighth, and was the higher ranked
                    of the two Sauber drivers. He became the second-youngest driver
                    to qualify on pole position in Formula One at the 2019 Bahrain
                    Grand Prix. The 2019 season also saw Leclerc take his first
                    career win in Belgium. He won the Pole Trophy in the 2019 season,
                    becoming the youngest driver to win it.

                    The moment I prefer is the moment I put on the helmet, that everyone is
                     leaving the pit lane, that I'm alone with the car and there it feels 
                     good. You don't have any feelings anymore; it's just racing and this I 
                     enjoy.
